Conversations and the dialogue system as a whole rely on multiple complicated parts to work properly.

The largest part of the dialogue system is the Conversation object that holds Conversant objects and outputs events to the dialogue listener.

Conversants hold a bunch of Statements as possible replies to other Statements

Statements have the following:
	An ID that lets them be called or addressed
	An animation trigger string that the Conversant or conversation UI may use to change a picture or animation. This is also how voice acting would happen.
	A Text String key that references a specific line of text. This isn't just the text because multiple statements may need to reference the same text and
	
A conversant must start a conversation with another conversant by saying a statement. At the beginning of conversation (and potentially later as needed) all conversants are queried as to whether they should join the conversation and are allowed to at this time. 
Then all conversants find which statements they can have as reply Statements to the previous Statement. 
	This happens until a conversant says something to which no conversant has a reply Statement or some (external) event happens that would stop a conversation.

What do I need to show?:

Player starts conversation
	plr_startconvo
Smiley has multiple Statements to start the conversation depending on rapport
	smi_nice_hi, smi_angry_hi (smi_freak_out)
Player can do multiple things
	plr_ask_weather, plr_ask_money, plr_draw_gun
Smiley's responses
	smi_respond_weather_nice, smi_respond_weather_angry, smi_give_money, smi_refuse_money, smi_freak_out
Player's Responses
	plr_goodbye
